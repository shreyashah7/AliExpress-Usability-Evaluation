# Usability Evaluation of AliExpress 

### Introduction

Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) involves studying the design of computing technologies and the ways that humans interact with them. Through HCI research, we can better understand the needs and pain-points of users and design interfaces that are compatible with their tendencies and capabilities and accommodating to their limitations.
One of the many benefits that come with technological advancements is the ability to buy products online and have them delivered to us. Since this is an activity that involves significant interaction with a computing technology, we decided to evaluate AliExpress, a Chinese online retail service which is a subsidiary of Alibaba Group of companies.

### Product Description 

AliExpress is an e-commerce portal that enables businesses or individuals to sell their products directly to consumers. Initially, AliExpress started as a business to business buying and selling platform. They later expanded it to business to consumer, consumer to consumer platform along with payment services. AliExpress provides a platform that allows Chinese business to directly sell to anyone around the world. Products bought from AliExpress take around 20 to 60 days to deliver. Products bought through AliExpress involve import duty as the products are delivered directly from China. One of the major concerns for AliExpress is fraudulent sellers, hence it is crucial for a buyer to determine that the seller and their products are legitimate.
AliExpress allows a person to buy from a wide range of product categories from womenâ€™s clothing to sports equipment. Users can track their orders, request refunds, obtain discounts, use coupons. It also has additional features like adding products to Wishlist, rating products, etc.

### Purpose

We have evaluated AliExpress interface for product search, product ordering and user profile management.
